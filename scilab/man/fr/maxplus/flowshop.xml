  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    T_ij ((i,j)-entry of matrix T) is the processing time of part j by machine i
    (T_ij = -inf if part j does not visit machine i) in a flowshop
    (in a flowshop, as opposed to a jobshop, all parts visit machines in
    the increasing order of the machine numbers with the possibility of skipping
    some machines). 
  </P>
  <P>
    A maxplus linear system is generated for the corresponding
    open-loop system (no cyclic use of machines or pallets carrying 
    the parts : inputs are the arrival times of parts at the inlet and the
    availaibility times of machines, outputs are the departure times of parts and
    the times at which machines are available again).
  </P>
  <P>
    The internal-state number is  mxp where m is 
    the machine-type  number and p is the part-type number 
    even if some states are not useful (the parts
    does not visit all the available machines).
  </P>
  <P>
    The input/output number is nm+np.
  </P>
  <P>
    The input/output counting is : 
  </P>
  <P>
    part 1 part 2 ... part p machine 1 machine 2 .....machine m 
  </P>
  <P>
    The state numbering is :
     
    (i=1,j=1) (i=1,j=2)... (i=1,j=p)
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
    (i=m,j=1) ............ (i=m,j=p).
  </P>
  <P>
    These countings do not  correspond to the internal
    node number shown by  flowshop_graph.
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
    T must not have a row or a column identical to -inf.
