  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    nm is a vector which yields
    the numbers of machines of each type working in parallel.
  </P>
  <P>
    np is a vector which yields the numbers
    of pallets of each type (parts of each type are carried by specialized
    pallets).
  </P>
  <P>
    flowshop_simu simulates a flowshop viewed as a maxplus linear system.
  </P>
  <P>
    The input data u is a matrix, the number of columns being the number of steps
    in the simulation  (number of events of each type to be produced), the number
    of rows is the number of inputs (which is equal to the size of nm plus the
    size of np). An entry of u tells at which date the input (machine or part
    corresponding to the row number) is made available for the k-th time, k being
    the column number (event number). 
  </P>
  <P>
    l yields the inverse of the throughput.
  </P>
  <P>
    The result of the simulation is held by y which
    is a matrix the columns of which are again numbered according to events
    whereas the rows are associated with the same resources (parts or machines) as
    for u. An entry of y is equal to the date at which the corresponding
    part or machine is delivered or freed minus the drift term (defined
    as the event number divided by the throughput). This normalisation keeps y
    bounded and one can identify the transient part and the asymptotic
    periodic part.
