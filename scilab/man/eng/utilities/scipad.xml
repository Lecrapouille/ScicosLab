  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>Scipad is a Scilab/Scicoslab text editor written in Tcl/Tk. It can be
    started with a fresh text buffer from Scilab/Scicoslab command line with the instruction
    <VERB>scipad()</VERB>, or it can open specific files if invoked with any
    of the calling sequences above.</P>

    <P>The same invocation adds further files to an already opened Scipad. If
    any of the arguments is a directory pathname, a file chooser starting in
    that directory pops up, allowing (multiple) selection of files.</P>

    <P>Scipad allows Windows like edition modes. Keyboard shortcuts are
    defined for most possible editing actions and reported by the menu
    entries.</P>

    <P>Additionally, the following shortcuts are defined:</P>

  <SECTION label="Debugger">
    <P>Scipad includes a debugger targeted to Scilab/Scicoslab scripts and macros. The
    user can:</P>

    <P></P>

    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM label="Set/remove breakpoints anywhere in the opened files.">
        <SP>The breakpointed lines get pink background. No breakpoint can be
        set on empty, blank or commented lines. Insertion and deletion of
        breakpoints can be done either before the debug session starts, and
        during such a session. Breakpoints can have a condition, which is a
        generic expression written in Scilab language. When the execution
        process encounters a breakpoint, this breakpoint is said to be
        reached. When the breakpoint is reached and its associated conditional
        expression is true (or changed, depending on the user's selection),
        then the breakpoint is said to be hit. The hit count is the number of
        times the breakpoint has been hit. Execution stops at a breakpoint if
        the hit count satisfies a selectable break condition. A user interface
        dedicated to breakpoints is available to control their conditional
        expression, the hit count and the break condition.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Remove all breakpoints.">
        <SP>This allows to quickly remove all the breakpoints from all
        currently opened files.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Configure execution.">
        <SP>The user has to provide the function name to execute, its variable
        names, and variable values. To ease this step, a scan of the currently
        displayed buffer is implemented to look for functions defined in it,
        scan their names and variable names. All this is displayed to the user
        in a dialog for easy selection. First, the user has to select a
        function, then eventually one of its variables. Once a
        variable is selected, the user can set/change its value (another
        dialog pops). Variable values and names are displayed in listboxes.
        The user can also add a new variable or remove already defined
        variables. This is in case the user changes the input variables of his
        function in the file, and he does not want to scan the buffer again
        (which causes all the variable values to be reset to a null value).
        Note also that the <LINK>varargin</LINK> keyword is fully supported,
        and that variables that are not given a value by the user are ignored
        when Scipad launches the function for debug. If the current file
        contains main level code (i.e. executable code outside of a function
        definition), Scipad proposes to debug this file as a .sce file (see
        below).</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>

    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM label="Go to next breakpoint.">
        <SP>Scilab executes the code, and stops at the next breakpoint or goes
        to the end of the file if there is no more breakpoints. The active
        breakpoint is highlighted in Scipad so that it can easily be
        identified.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Execute step by step, going into functions (step into).">
        <SP>Scilab stops before execution of each line. The active stop
        position is highlighted in Scipad so that it can easily be identified.
        Every line of code in functions from opened files is taken into
        account, but Scipad does not search for or open files by itself in
        order to step into them. Lines with no executable code (blank or
        commented lines) are skipped.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Execute step by step, without going into ancillary functions (step over).">
        <SP>Similar to step into, but ancillaries are executed at once without
        stepping into them. However, if the user has set a breakpoint in an
        ancillary, Scilab will nevertheless stop at this breakpoint.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Execute step by step, starting back from the return point of the current function (step out).">
        <SP>Scilab executes instructions until the function returns from the
        current context, i.e. the next stop occurs just after the current
        function has returned. However, if the user has set a breakpoint in
        the current function or in an ancillary, Scilab will nevertheless stop
        at this breakpoint. Lines with no executable code (blank or commented
        lines) are skipped.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Run execution up to the next return point.">
        <SP>Scilab executes instructions until the next return point is
        reached. It stops just before executing the line that will make the
        current nest level to return. If the user has set breakpoints in the
        current function or in an ancillary, Scilab will skip them and stop
        only when the return point is reached. The list of exit points for the
        current function includes the line containing the endfunction keyword
        corresponding to the function declaration line (there can be only one
        such line in Scilab, no multiple "endfunction" for one "function"),
        but also possibly multiple "return" and "resume" statements.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Run execution up to the cursor position.">
        <SP>Scilab executes instructions until the cursor position is reached.
        If the user has set breakpoints in the current function or in an
        ancillary, Scilab will skip them and stop only when the cursor
        position is reached. Lines with no executable code (blank or commented
        lines) are also skipped: if the cursor is in such a line, Scilab will
        stop just before executing the next line carrying executable
        code.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Continue ignoring any breakpoint.">
        <SP>Finish execution in Scilab as if there was no breakpoint at
        all.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Break execution.">
        <SP>Scilab pauses execution. This is useful to check out where a long
        script is stuck, e.g. in case of an endless loop.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM label="Abort debug.">
        <SP>Abort execution in Scilab and cancel the current debug session in
        Scipad.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>

    <P>When one of the run commands above is triggered for the first time,
    Scipad launches execution, i.e. it execs the currently displayed buffer as
    well as all the opened buffers that contain functions, sends to Scilab the
    <LINK>setbpt</LINK> instructions relative to all the breakpoints that have
    been set, and executes the selected function with the input variable
    values provided during the configure execution step. Then the execution is
    automagically stopped by Scilab according to the debug command that was
    launched. A new debug command can then be executed.</P>

    <P></P>

    <P>At any time during the debug, a <BD>watch window</BD> can be displayed
    on user request. It allows to monitor any variable value, or change a
    variable value during a breakpoint stop and relaunch execution with the
    modified value. A watchable variable can be part of a larger structure,
    for instance if A is a 20x20 matrix, the shorter sub-matrix A(2:4,7:9) can
    be watched. The user can also watch all local variables without having to
    input their name manually, or all locals and (locally referenced) nolocals
    at the same time. It is also possible to "watch" generic expressions, i.e.
    enter a list of expressions that will be evaluated whenever execution
    stops, so that for instance an array can be plotted at each step. The
    watch window also displays the calling stack and contains a toolbar with
    the most useful commands from the debug menu.</P>

    <P></P>

    <P>In its current development state the debugger works well with
    functions, i.e. <BD>pure .sci files</BD>, but support of .sce files or
    mixed .sce/.sci files is however also fully implemented. Debug of .sce or
    mixed .sce/sci files makes use of the implementation for the .sci case
    after having automatically wrapped the code in a function/endfunction
    clause. The wrapper is automatically removed when the debug ends.</P>

    <P></P>

    <P>Due to technical limitations, <BD>ancillary files of Scipad</BD> cannot
    be debugged nor stepped into. During the configure step, Scipad detects if
    the user intends to configure one of its ancillaries for debugging, and
    prevents from doing so. The list of reserved function names is then
    displayed in a message box. In case it is really needed to debug a Scipad
    ancillary, it is possible to try to change the name of the reserved
    function in order to debug a copy of it, but there are some catches to
    that, if the function calls itself other reserved ancillaries, or if the
    original file is still currently opened. Not only the name of the function
    in its definition line should be changed, but also any call to this
    function, and any call to the original function ancillaries if the
    original file is still open.</P>

    <P></P>

    <P><BD>The debugger fully works with Scilab 4.1.2 or Scicoslab. Unfortunately
    it does not work with Scilab 5.</BD> For more information about the reasons
    for this, and for details about the way the debugger internally works,
    please read:

      <ITEM label="Localisation:">
        <P></P>

        <SP>Scipad menues and messages can be translated to several languages.
        The very first time Scipad is launched from a new Scilab/Scicoslab installation,
        the language used by Scipad is the Scilab language. If the Scilab
        language is not available in Scipad, then the English fallback is
        used. Later, the localization in effect can be selected with the menu
        Options/Locale and is remembered across sessions. Currently, the
        supported languages are: "ca_es" (Catalan), "da_dk" (Danish), "de_de"
        (German), "en_us" (English), "es_es" (Spanish), "fr_fr" (French),
        "it_it" (Italian), "ja_jp" (Japanese), "no" (Norwegian), "pl"
        (Polish), "se" (Swedish), "zh_cn" (Chinese-simplified), "zh_tw"
        (Chinese-Taiwan).</SP>

        <SP>Further languages can be added by creating the proper translation
        file and putting it in <VERB>SCI/tcl/scipadsources/msg_files/</VERB>.
        If you plan to do such a job, please check the file
        <VERB>SCI/tcl/scipadsources/msg_files/AddingTranslations.txt</VERB>

        opening a file or a list of files.</SP>

        <P>Dragging one or more files from an explorer and dropping to Scipad
        will open the file(s) in Scipad. Doing the same with a directory will

        <P>For text selected within the Scipad window, the possible actions

      <ITEM label="Additional features in Scipad and most recent developments:">
        <P></P>

        <SP>Scipad should run on Tcl/Tk 8.4.6 or higher. Scipad however offers
        a handful of quite handy features that are available as soon as Tcl/Tk
        8.5 (or higher) is running in its background. For instance, peer text widgets are
        available from Tk 8.5, and this capability is used in Scipad to allow
        for displaying more than one contiguous area of an opened file at a
        time in tile mode. Scilab 5 and Scicoslab are currently shipped with Tcl/Tk 8.5 (at
        least on Windows). Should you need to upgrade from Tcl/Tk8.4,
        instructions about how to do this can be found on the Scilab wiki:
