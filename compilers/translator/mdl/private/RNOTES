You may want to try the very very beginning of a Simulink import
mechanism that I have developed in ScicosLab as a prototype for
the more serious Caml version.

1./
Just go to MDL/scilab, open the file "sciparse.sci" and edit the line
 getd("c:/cygwin/home/ramin/MDL/scilab/")
by putting the right path for you. Then open scicoslab and do

2./
cd XXXX/MDL/scilab

3./

exec('sciparse.sce',-1);
testing('../test_data/untitled.mdl')

after the pause (_do_not_resume_!_) :

scicos(scs_m)

Don't expect too much !

I just updated sciparse to show how the translation of new blocks can be added.
The two blocks unitdealy and scope I just added are very partially supported;
simulink has more options. I also found a limitation in Scicos:
the input sizes of the CMSCOPE block cannot be negative. The reasons seem to be that
1- the sizes are used to make sure there are enough colors,
2- the sizes are placed inside ipar in job='set', and used in C.

For 1, we can just remove the test and change the C code so that it takes the last
color if we don't have enough colors.

For 2, it is now possible to reset ipar in job='compile' (we can even do the test for 1-).
But the sizes of inputs are already available in C so there is no point even placing it ipar.
Unfortunately chanign ipar can affect backward compatibility with compiled diagrams.
o it is better to use job='compile'.


Note that the translator replaces simulinks blocks with super blocks and places
 the parameters of each block in the context of the super block, except for a few
 blocks that it knows (inport, outport, unitdelay, scope, mux, demux) which are fully translated.

If a subsystem is masked, it is also masked in scicos.

Not useful for now because there is no way to enter a super block without removing the mask,
but it was a good test for the translation of masking--try forexample the kalmanfilter model
(don't worry about the error messages about unknown parameters; the simulink model contains
 parameters that must be defined in Matlab before).

Normally a lot of models should pass the translator. The ones that will not pass contain
1- unknown block types (not defined in MDL/simulinkslib/mdl_pervasives.mdli).
   Unfortunately some of our test examples use fancy libraries such as powerlib not in pervasive

2- implicit links: links of type "connection". I have not had the time to parse those yet.
   A lot of them are among the test examples we have.

If you have straight classical simulinks models, try sciparse on them (or just commit to test_data) and let me know.

The first diagram that runs: simple1. It requires latest SVN.
