Port types other than regular input and output in Simulink:
----------------------------------------------------------

State Port:
-----------
 Ports		  [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]
The fifth port is "state" port. It is an output port. Ex:
	Line {
	  SrcBlock		  "Engine\nIntegrator"
	  SrcPort		  state
	  DstBlock		  "Goto"
	  DstPort		  1
	}
It gives direct access to the internal state of a block.

Enable Port:
-------------
 Ports		      [1, 1, 1]
The third port is "enable" port. It is a special input port placed
on top of the block.
Only one or zero enable ports per Super block.
Super block has enable port if it contains a EnablePort block. 
Example:
		Block {
		  BlockType		  EnablePort
		  Name			  "Enable"
		  SID			  45
		  Ports			  []
		  Position		  [150, 70, 170, 90]
Note that EnablePort has no input or output.
The "enable" port is connected to a regular (boolean type) output
port, e.g.:
	    Line {
	      SrcBlock		      "Relational\nOperator1"
	      SrcPort		      1
	      Points		      [50, 0]
	      Branch {
		DstBlock		"S&H 1"
		DstPort			enable
	      }


Trigger Port:
-------------
  Ports		      [9, 38, 0, 1]
The forth port is the trigger port. It is a special input port placed
on top of the block.
Only one or zero trigger ports per Super block.
Super block has trigger port if it contains a TriggerPort  block. 
Example:
   }
    Block {
      BlockType		      TriggerPort
      TriggerType	      "rising"
      StatesWhenEnabling      "inherit"
      ShowOutputPort	      off
      OutputDataType	      "auto"
      SampleTimeType	      "triggered"
      SampleTime	      "1"
      ZeroCross		      on
    }
There are 3 TriggerTypes: rising, falling, either. Default is rising.
The block may have 0 or 1 regular output. If the output is present, it 
specifies how the type of triggering: 
-  1: rising
- -1: falling
-  0: other


Ifaction Port:
-------------- 
 Ports		      [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
The 8th port is the ifaction port. It is a special input port placed
on top of the block. Example of a connection to this port:
  Line {
      SrcBlock		      "If"
      SrcPort		      1
      Points		      [55, 0]
      DstBlock		      "If Action\nSubsystem"
      DstPort		      ifaction
    }
The Super block has an ifaction port if it contains an ActionPort block:
	Block {
	  BlockType		  ActionPort
	  Name			  "Action Port"
	  Position		  [170, 15, 229, 43]
	  ActionType		  "then"
	}
Only regular outputs of "If" or "SwitchCase" blocks can be connected to 
ifaction port of a Super Block. Example of a "If" block having two 
outputs:
  Block {
      BlockType		      If
      Name		      "If"
      Ports		      [1, 2]
      Position		      [35, 31, 135, 69]
      IfExpression	      "u1 < x_dot_max"
    }
