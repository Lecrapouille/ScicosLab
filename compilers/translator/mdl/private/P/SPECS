Sémantiques des blocs:
* semantics of I/O behaviour of blocks: a pure function ?
* semantics of the so-called state; is it really a writable state or some hidden (output) results ?
* semantics of scheduling

* semantics of type-checking (static semantics): which algebra ? which
  algorithms ? Need polymorphism ? Need overloading ?
  Is there already some results about inference, complexity
  tracktability ?
